    developed my productions and gathered enough followers to make this my full time profession. He happily quit my day
    job in late 2013.

<P>
    He have managed to keep all of my productions free so far by relying solely on advertising revenue and voluntary
    donations. He have a huge appreciation for the support and the kindness of my YouTube followers. In return for their
    loyalty He have committed my future to continuing to produce the best quality guitar tuition for free.
